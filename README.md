A [pi](https://pi.dev) extension that auto-sets the thinking level each turn via
an **online prompt-difficulty classifier**. The idea is borrowed from
[oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi)'s `auto` thinking level.

Each interactive turn, before the agent runs, a small **classifier model** rates
the prompt `low | medium | high | xhigh`, clamps it into your configured bounds,
and sets the thinking level for that turn. Trivial prompts stay cheap; hard ones
get reasoning budget. Short continuations (`continue`, `yes`, `ok`) return `keep`
and leave the level unchanged. On any failure (timeout, no key, unparseable
reply) it preserves the current level and never throws.

The valid thinking levels are never hard-coded — they come from pi's
`getSupportedThinkingLevels(model)`, so the classifier only ever picks among
levels the active model actually offers.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-auto-thinking
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/aesisify/pi-auto-thinking
```

## Configure

Config lives under a `pi-auto-thinking/` folder in your pi config root.
Project-local config shadows user-global.

- User:     `~/.pi/agent/pi-auto-thinking/config.json`
- Project:  `<project>/.pi/pi-auto-thinking/config.json`

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "classifier": "ollama/qwen2.5:3b",
  "classifierLevel": "off",
  "minLevel": "low",
  "maxLevel": "xhigh",
  "timeoutMs": 8000,
  "maxTokens": 512
}
```

`ollama/qwen2.5:3b` is recommended for a local [ollama](https://ollama.com)
classifier — small and fast enough to rate each prompt near instantly, with no
per-turn cost. Pull it with `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`. Any cloud model
(`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, `openai/gpt-5-mini`, …) works too.

| ----------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`         | `true`    | Master switch. `false` disables the classifier.      |
| `classifier`      | _(none)_  | `"provider/model"` — pi convention. Unset ⇒ inactive.|
| `minLevel`        | `low`     | Floor.                                               |
| `maxLevel`        | `xhigh`   | Ceiling.                                             |
| `timeoutMs`       | `4000`    | Per-turn classification budget before fallback.      |
| `maxTokens`       | `4096`    | Reasoning-safe cap (headroom for thinking-on models).|
| `classifierLevel` | `off`     | Reasoning effort for the classifier call.            |

## Commands

```
/auto-thinking          # status (default): active, classifier, bounds, last decision
/auto-thinking status   # explicit status
/auto-thinking on|off   # toggle for this session
```

Config is re-read each turn; run pi's built-in `/reload` to re-initialize after editing.

A footer statusline shows `auto→high` (last decision) or `auto:off`.

## Logs

Decision/fallback events are written to rolling log files:

- `~/.pi/agent/pi-auto-thinking/logs/<date>.log`

Rotation: daily, max 5 MB per file, keep 14 days.

## Local trial changes

This local checkout retains the 0.1.2 classification prompt, parser, bounds,
timeout, and input eligibility. It omits `temperature` only for the
`openai-codex-responses` API, which rejects that parameter.

Decision logs additionally include session/file/parent-entry identifiers, input
source, UI presence, main and classifier models, thinking before/after, classifier
usage, stop reason, and provider errors. Skipped inputs are logged with their
reason so an unused extension can be distinguished from an ineligible input.
The resolved classifier API key is redacted from provider error messages. Prompt
bodies and classifier reasoning are not added to these records.

## Tests

Node-native (`node:test`), no framework. Requires Node ≥22.6 (unit) / ≥22.7 (integration).

```bash
npm test                 # unit tests (pure functions + config/logger/paths)
npm run test:integration # extension wiring via a loader + shims
npm run test:all         # both
```
